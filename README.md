## Problem Statement: 
We are given the Bayesian Network created by the researchers. The network is shown below:

Eight diagnoses are modeled here: hypovolemia, left ventricular failure, Anaphylaxis, insufficient
analgesia, pulmonary embolus, intubation, kinked tube, and disconnection. The observable nodes are CVP,
PCWP, History, TPR, Blood Pressure, CO, HR BP, HR EKG, HR SAT, SaO2, PAP, MV, Min Vol, Exp CO2,
FiO2 and Pres.

Such networks can be represented in many formats. We will use the .bif format. BIF stands for Bayesian
Interchange Format. The details about the format are here. We are also providing a .bif parser so that you can
start directly from a parsed Bayesian network represented as a graph.
